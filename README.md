# QR Decomposition and Householder Transformation

## QR Decomposition

QR decomposition is a foundational technique in the realm of linear algebra. It involves breaking down a given matrix into the product of two distinct matrices, Q and R. In this context:
- Matrix Q is orthogonal, with its columns representing mutually orthogonal unit vectors.
- Matrix R is upper triangular, with all entries below the main diagonal set to zero.

This decomposition has widespread applications, including:
- Solving systems of linear equations
- Eigenvalue computations
- Least squares fitting procedures

## Householder Transformation

The Householder transformation serves as a pivotal strategy employed to carry out QR decomposition. Functioning as a geometric metamorphosis, this technique orchestrates the reflection of a vector within a higher-dimensional spatial realm, relative to a designated plane. The core concept behind the Householder transformation is the gradual elimination of components residing beneath a predetermined entry within a vector. This process achieves component nullification while preserving the orthogonality of the remaining vectors.

## QR Decomposition through Householder Transformation

Let's delve into the steps of QR decomposition through the Householder transformation:

1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a given matrix A (m√ón) that we wish to decompose into Q and R. Begin with A and an identity matrix I (of the same size as A).

2. **Iteration**: For each column indexed by j (from 1 to n), follow these steps:
   - a. Consider the submatrix A[j:m, j:n], containing elements beyond the current column and below the current row.
   - b. Compute a Householder vector v that acts as a transformation to eliminate subdiagonal entries in the first column of A[j:m, j:n]. The Householder vector can be calculated as v = a - ||a|| * e, where 'a' represents the first column of A[j:m, j:n], and 'e' is a standard unit vector in the same direction.
   - c. Calculate the Householder matrix H = I - 2 * (v * v^T) / (v^T * v), representing the reflection transformation with respect to the Householder vector.
   - d. Update the submatrix A[j:m, j:n] by applying the Householder transformation: A[j:m, j:n] = H * A[j:m, j:n].

3. **Building Q and R**: Following the Householder transformations applied to each column, the resulting matrix A takes on an upper triangular form (R). The orthogonal matrix Q emerges from the sequence of Householder vectors utilized in the transformations. Q is obtained by accumulating the individual Householder matrices.

In summary, the Householder transformation method for QR decomposition undertakes a sequence of orthogonal transformations on the input matrix, ultimately eliminating targeted elements below the diagonal. This process culminates in an upper triangular matrix, with the collected Householder transformations yielding the orthogonal matrix Q. This decomposition stands as a robust and efficient tool in various numerical algorithms.
